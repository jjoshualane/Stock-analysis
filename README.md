## Stock-analysis using excel VBA

### Overview of Project
#### Purpose
##### The reason for this project was to refactor the Microsoft Excel VBA code on certain stocks for 2017 and 2018. We wanted to know if the stocks were worth continuing to invest in. We worked on this throughout the module however the goal was to see if we could get the code to run faster.

#### The Data
##### The data that we have are on twelve different stock based off the years 2017 and 2018. The stock information included a ticker value, the opening and closing price, the highest and lowest price and the volume of the stock also the date the stock was issued. The goal for us was to get the return on each stock.

### Results
#### Analysis
##### Before i refactored the code I copied the code over to the stock analysis worksheet and created a new module for the code. I then filled in all the information requested so that i could get the code to run faster. The code asked me to input three arrays, and create a for loop. I have listed below what the refactored cod should look like.![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95378573/147427038-75635eb7-2ec6-487f-84c0-daddb9ad80c9.png)

### Summary
#### Pros and Cons of refactoring Code
##### Refactoring allowes us to make our code cleaner. The pros of cleaning up our code is that we can make our code run faster, we can also redesign our code so that its easier to view. The cons of refactoring code is that it can be time consuming and that you may find yourself in a situation where you have no idea where to go and it might introduce bugs.

#### The Advantages of Refactoring Stock Analysis
##### The biggest advantage is that you can quicken your macro run time. The original analysis took roughly 0.75 seconds to run whereas the refactored only took 0.125 seconds to run. I have an image of the 2017 and 2018 refactored run time listed below.
